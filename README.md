#MongoDB + Pub/Sub

Welcome to [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)! This is an implementation of publish/subscribe on top of MongoDB using [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org). A MongoDB summer 2014 intern project by [Alex Grover](https://github.com/ajgrover) and [Esha Maharishi](https://github.com/EshaMaharishi).

Note: this is a prototype and is _not_ production ready.

##Building

See docs/building.md or navigate to www.mongodb.org and search for "Building".

##Drivers

An example node.js driver is available [here](https://github.com/ajgrover/node-mongodb-pubsub). This driver provides access to all the additional functionality implemented here.
