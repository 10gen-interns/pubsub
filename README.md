MongoDB + Pub/Sub
=================

Welcome to [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)! This is an implementation of publish/subscribe on top of MongoDB v2.6.3 using [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org). A MongoDB summer 2014 intern project by [Alex Grover](https://github.com/ajgrover) and [Esha Maharishi](https://github.com/EshaMaharishi).

Note: this is a prototype and is _not_ production ready.

# Building

See docs/building.md or navigate to www.mongodb.org and search for "Building".

# Drivers

An example node.js driver is available [here](https://github.com/ajgrover/node-mongodb-pubsub). This driver provides access to all the additional functionality implemented here.

# Design

- why ZeroMQ?
- design considerations
- where we are today

# Features

- regular pubsub
- filters/projections
- database event notifications

# API Documentation

In addition to MongoDB's basic behavior, we implemented 4 additional database commands: `publish`, `subscribe`, `poll`, and `unsubscribe`.

These are accessible from the Mongo shell through the `ps` variable.

```javascript
> var ps = db.PS()
> var subscription = ps.subscribe(channel, [filter], [projection]) // returns a Subscription object
> ps.publish(channel, message)
> subscription.poll([timeout]) // returns message
> subscription.unsubscribe()
```

The server API for for each of these commands is as follows:

## Publish

Signature:

```
{ publish : <channel>, message : <message> }
```

From the Mongo shell:

```
ps.publish(channel, message)
```

Arguments:

- `channel` Required. Must be a string.
- `message` Required. Must be an object.

Other:

- The channel `$events` is reserved for database event notifications and will return an error if a user attempts to publish to it.

## Subscribe

```
{ subscribe : <channel>, filter : <filter>, projection: <projection> }
```

From the Mongo shell:

```
ps.subscribe(channel, [filter], [projection]) // returns a Subscription
```

Arguments:

- `channel` Required. Must be a string. Channel matching is done by ZeroMQ's prefix matching.
- `filter` Optional. Must be an object. Specifies a filter to apply to incoming messages.
- `projection` Optional. Must be an object. Specifies fields of incoming messages to return.

Filters and projections in pubsub have the same syntax as the query and projection fields of a read command. See [here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/query-documents/) for documentation on filter syntax and [here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/) for documentation on projection syntax.

### Database Events

## Poll

Signature:

```
{ poll : <subscriptionId(s)>, timeout : <timeout> }
```

From the Mongo shell:

```
subscription.poll([timeout])
ps.poll(subscription.getId(), [timeout])
ps.poll([ subscriptionIds ], [timeout])
```

Arguments:

- `subscriptionId` Required. Must be an ObjectId or array of ObjectIds.
- `timeout` Optional. Must be an Int, Long, or Double. Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait on the server if no messeges are available. If the number is a Double, it is rounded down to the nearest integer. If no timeout is specified, the default is to return immediately.

Errors:

- In the event that an array is passed and not all array members are ObjectIds, the command will fail and no messages will be received on any subscription.
- In the event that an array is passed and an ObjectId is not a valid subscription, an error string will be appended to result.errors[invalid ObjectId].

## Unsubscribe

Signature:

```
{ unsubscribe : <subscriptionId(s)> }
```

From the Mongo shell:

```
subscription.unsubscribe()
ps.unsubscribe(subscription.getId())
ps.unsubscribe([subscriptionIds])
```

Arguments:

- `subscriptionId` Required. Must be an ObjectId or array of ObjectIds.

Errors:

- In the event that an array is passed and not all array members are ObjectIds, the command will fail and no subscriptions will be unsubscribed.
- In the event that an array is passed and an ObjectId is not a valid subscription, an error string will be appended to result.errors[invalid ObjectId].

## Database Events

- document shell helper

# Performance

- include graphs and numbers here

# TODO

- Use secure connections for internally propagating messages over ZMQ (Curve or SSL)
- Allow for exact matching channels rather than just ZMQâ€™s prefix matching
- Add secure access to subscriptions
- Internal system to allow synchronized on/off across cluster
- Only propagate messages internally to nodes who are subscribed
- Allow enable/disable of pubsub at runtime
