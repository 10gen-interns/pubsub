#MongoDB + Pub/Sub

Welcome to [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)! This is an implementation of publish/subscribe on top of MongoDB v2.6.3 using [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org). A MongoDB summer 2014 intern project by [Alex Grover](https://github.com/ajgrover) and [Esha Maharishi](https://github.com/EshaMaharishi).

Note: this is a prototype and is _not_ production ready.

##Building

See docs/building.md or navigate to www.mongodb.org and search for "Building".

##Drivers

An example node.js driver is available [here](https://github.com/ajgrover/node-mongodb-pubsub). This driver provides access to all the additional functionality implemented here.

##Design

- why ZeroMQ?
- design considerations
- where we are today

##Features

- filters/projections
- database event notifications

##API Documentation

In addition to MongoDB's basic behavior, we implemented 4 additional database commands: `publish`, `subscribe`, `poll`, and `unsubscribe`.

###Publish

- document signature and behavior, errors

###Subscribe

- document signature and behavior, errors, filters and projections

####Database Events

- document channels and behavior, setParameter

###Unsubscribe

- document signature and behavior, errors

##Performance

- include graphs and numbers here

##TODO

- Use secure connections for internally propagating messages over ZMQ (Curve or SSL)
- Allow for exact matching channels rather than just ZMQâ€™s prefix matching
- Add secure access to subscriptions
- Internal system to allow synchronized on/off across cluster
- Only propagate messages internally to nodes who are subscribed
- Allow enable/disable of pubsub at runtime
