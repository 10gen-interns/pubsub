#MongoDB + Pub/Sub

Welcome to [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)! This is an implementation of publish/subscribe on top of MongoDB v2.6.3 using [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org). A MongoDB summer 2014 intern project by [Alex Grover](https://github.com/ajgrover) and [Esha Maharishi](https://github.com/EshaMaharishi).

Note: this is a prototype and is _not_ production ready.

##Building

See docs/building.md or navigate to www.mongodb.org and search for "Building".

##Drivers

An example node.js driver is available [here](https://github.com/ajgrover/node-mongodb-pubsub). This driver provides access to all the additional functionality implemented here.

##Design

- why ZeroMQ?
- design considerations
- where we are today

##Features

- filters/projections
- database event notifications

##API Documentation

In addition to MongoDB's basic behavior, we implemented 4 additional database commands: `publish`, `subscribe`, `poll`, and `unsubscribe`.

These are accessible from the Mongo shell through the `ps` variable.

```javascript
> var ps = db.PS()
> var subscription = ps.subscribe(channel, [filter], [projection]) // returns a Subscription object
> ps.publish(channel, message)
> subscription.poll([timeout]) // returns message
> subscription.unsubscribe()
```

The server API for for each of these commands is as follows:

The API

###Publish

Signature:

```
{ publish : <channel>, message : <message> }
```

From the Mongo shell:

```
ps.publish(channel, message)
```

Arguments:

- `channel` Required. Must be a string.
- `message` Required. Must be a document.

Other:

- The channel `$events` is reserved for database event notifications and will return an error if a user attempts to publish to it.

###Subscribe

- document signature and behavior, errors, filters and projections
- document shell helper

####Subscriptions

- document subscription object methods
- document shell helper

####Database Events

- document channels and behavior, setParameter
- document shell helper

###Unsubscribe

- document signature and behavior, errors
- document shell helper

##Performance

- include graphs and numbers here

##TODO

- Use secure connections for internally propagating messages over ZMQ (Curve or SSL)
- Allow for exact matching channels rather than just ZMQâ€™s prefix matching
- Add secure access to subscriptions
- Internal system to allow synchronized on/off across cluster
- Only propagate messages internally to nodes who are subscribed
- Allow enable/disable of pubsub at runtime
